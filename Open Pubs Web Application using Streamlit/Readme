Task - Open Pub Application


Letâ€™s assume you are on a vacation in the United Kingdom with your friends. Just for some fun, you decided to go to the Pubs nearby for some drinks. Google Map is down because of some issues. 

While searching the internet, you came across https://www.getthedata.com/open-pubs. On this website, you found all the pub locations (Specifically Latitude and Longitude info). In order to impress your friends, you decided to create a web application with the data available in your hand. (Go through the requirements mentioned below)

Task - Create a multi page application using Streamlit with the following requirements.

Page Number 1 - (Home Page)
It should be like a welcome page. Show some basic information and statistics about the dataset.


Page Number 2 - (Pub Locations)
Display a map. Based on the Postal Code or Local Authority, display all the pubs in the area chosen. 

Page Number 3 - (Find the nearest Pub)
Ask the user to enter his/her Latitude and Longitude. Display the nearest 5 Pubs on the map. Use Euclidean Distance to find the nearest pubs.


Hint - There are some Null Values in the Latitude and Longitude Column. Use Jupyter Notebook to either impute the null values or delete the rows and then proceed with app development.
